Intuitive user interface:
    We created an easy-to-use user interface not using the actuall QT GUI editor.
   
Building:
    [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) framework is required for build (tested with Qt 5.6.2).

    Makefile:
    - 'make' builds the application ([Qt](https://www.qt.io/) required)
    - 'make run' will start the application
    - 'make doxygen' will generate documentation in 'doc/' folder, ([doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) required)
    - 'make clean' will remove build files
